\frametitle{Further discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss the representation theory of $K^{G_{\dimvec{d}}}(\St_{\dimvec{d}})$, and connect that with the geometry of $\Flag_{d}(M)$;
\item Generalize the result of first part to partial flag varieties (by introducing merge and split);
\item Understand Kazhdan-Lusztig isomorphism and its categorifications;
\item Understand ``KLR-algebra categorifies quantum groups''.
\end{itemize}
