\begin{block}{Corollary}
For a Dynkin quiver, we can give an total order to the set of all indecomposable representations, such that
$$i \leqslant j \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \Ext^1(M_i, M_j)=0.$$
\end{block}

By Theorem A, the problem reduced to
\begin{short}
For a Dynkin quiver $Q$ and $M \in \ind(Q)$,
$$\Flag_{d}(M) \text{ has an affine paving.}$$
